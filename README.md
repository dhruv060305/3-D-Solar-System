# 🌌 3D Solar System – Dhruv Taraviya

An interactive 3D simulation of the solar system built using React, Three.js, and @react-three/fiber. This project visualizes planetary motion with accurate textures, orbital tilt, and self-rotation, along with speed controls and a starry background.

## 🚀 Features

- Realistic planet textures and scaled sizes
- Emissive textured Sun with point light source
- Orbital tilts based on real planetary inclinations
- Planetary revolution and self-rotation
- Speed controls and reset functionality
- Play and pause feature
- Star background using drei's Stars
- Responsive layout and interactive orbit controls
